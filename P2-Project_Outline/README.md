## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our project is a behavioral intervention resource site ("Name goes here") dedicated to providing teachers and educators
access to a complex intervention glossary in order to address behavioral needs for their students. 

The heart of this web app is a database of hundreds of interventions. Users will be able to find interventions,
record data on the interventions they've tried, and log in to curate a personal list of interventions for a particular student.

This project was conceived with a desire to easily and informally help teachers in the classroom.
