## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our project is an executive functioning intervention resource site ("Name goes here") dedicated to providing 
access to a complex intervention glossary in order to address behavioral needs. 

The heart of this web app is a database of hundreds of interventions. Users will be able to find interventions,
record data on the interventions they've tried, and log in to curate a personal list of interventions for a particular student.

This project was conceived with a desire to easily and informally help people navigate situations in their work world,
classroom, family, etc.
